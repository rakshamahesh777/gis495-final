0,Project Overview,media/superfund_pic.png,Image Source: U.S Environmental Protection Agency,https://www.epa.gov/mo/celebrating-10-years-tribes-cleanup-partnership-tar-creek-superfund-site,"Minority populations have a history of being disproportionately exposed to environmental issues, including hazardous waste like Superfund sites. In addition, there are many studies that support that minority populations are also more susceptible to negative environmental health impacts as a result. North Carolina has a total of 38 active Superfund sites, more than many other states. Being the birthplace of the Environmental Justice movement, North Carolina has a unique history of minority communities being unfairly exposed to hazardous waste.This raises the question if these inequalities are still present today. This project aims to examine Superfund site distribution in relation to minority populations in North Carolina, and determine whether sites are unequally concentrated in minority communities across the state.

1,What is a Superfund Site?,media/sf_overview.jpg,Image Source: Encyclopedia of Puget Sound,https://www.eopugetsound.org/magazine/IS/pollution-disadvantaged-communities,"A Superfund Site is a hazardous waste site established by the EPA&rsquo;s Superfund Program designated for cleanup. They&rsquo;re often past manufacturing plants, processing plants, or landfills deemed unsafe or harmful to the public and environment. People exposed to Superfund Sites may experience health effects, like respiratory illness, birth defects, and increased cancer risk. An active Superfund site is put on the EPA&rsquo;s <em>National Priorities List</em> until it is cleaned up and declared safe for public interaction.",7,Hidden,blue,North Carolina,35.7882396,-78.6373757,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
2,Warren County : The Birthplace of the Environmental Justice Movement,media/pcb_protest.jpg,Image Source: NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources,https://www.dncr.nc.gov/blog/2013/02/26/watershed-moment-environmental-justice-warren-county-pcb-protests,"The environmental justice movement sparked from Warren County&rsquo;s PCBs Protests in the 1980s. Residents of Warren County, a predominantly Black county, began to protest the establishment of a PCBs landfill in the community. This occurred as the nation was becoming increasingly aware of the effects of hazardous waste like PCBs, causing the government to take action on establishing hazardous waste removal processes. However, this often resulted in hazardous waste sites being placed near minority communities. The attention these protests received highlighted Warren County as a case study in the bigger pattern of environmental injustice affecting minority communities.",12,Plain,blue,Warren County,36.39659,-78.1069,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
3,Superfund Distribution,media/nc_sf.jpg,Image Source: Raksha Mahesh,,This is a map that plots active Superfund sites on top of minority percentages by county. Sites appear to be approximately equally distributed between counties with low and mid ranged minority percentages. ,7,Hidden,blue,North Carolina,35.7844945,-78.6206819,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
4,Top 10 Counties,media/top_10.jpg,Image Source: Raksha Mahesh,,"The top 3 counties with the most Superfund sites were Gaston County, Buncombe County, and Wake County. <strong>Gaston County</strong> has the highest number of sites, with a total of 4. We will examine Gaston County at a closer scale to see where these sites are located on a smaller, census tract level in relation to minority percentage.",7,Hidden,blue,North Carolina,35.7864724,-78.6644827,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
5,Superfund Sites in Gaston County,media/gaston_sf.jpg,Image Source: Raksha Mahesh,,This map plots active Superfund sites on top of minority percentages by census tract in Gaston County. The four sites appear evenly distributed between low minority percentage census tracts and mid-range minority percentage census tracts. ,12,Plain,blue,Gaston County,35.29437,-81.18025,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
6,Correlation Analysis,media/corr_no_zero.png,Image Source: Raksha Mahesh,,"<p style=""text-align: left;"">The correlation plot calculates the correlation between number of Superfund Sites and minority percentage per county, excluding counties that do not have any sites. Pearson's correlation coefficient was -0.05, which indicates an extremely weak negative correlation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with -1 indicating a very high negative correlation, and 1 indicating a very high positive correlation. A negative relationship suggests that when one variable increases, the other decreases. In contrast, a positive relationship suggests that when one variable increases, the other increases as well and vice versa. A value closer to 0 indicates no correlation between the two variables.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Pearson correlation coefficient value of -0.05, not only is very close to 0, but also is negative, which is the opposite of what was expected. The prediction based on historical context was that the number of Superfund Sites and minority percentage per county would have a positive correlation, however, this value does not reflect that.</p>",7,Hidden,blue,North Carolina,35.6506362,-78.706852,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
7,Discussion,,,,"<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Based on the visuals and correlation analysis, there does not seem to be a disproportionate number of Superfund Sites in counties with higher minority percentages in North Carolina <strong>at a county level</strong>.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, the analysis conducted had limitations which restricted us from effectively answering the research question:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">County-level analysis didn't allow for examination of where sites were placed within each counties</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Social factors like gerrymandering were not mapped</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Minority populations may be concentrated in specific areas within a county</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The use of minority percentage blankets all minority races together</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There may be certain races being affected more than others</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Correlation analysis is very surface level</span>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if correlation was found, correlation does not equal causation</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More advanced statistical tests could more accurately determine spatial relationships</span></li>

8,Future Analysis,,,,"This research question should continue to be explored in order to determine a strong conclusion after addressing the limitations to this initial analysis. New methods involving the addition of other variables like income and poverty into statistical analysis could be helpful to determining more big picture takeaways. A more advanced statistical analysis could help deeper dive into more smaller-scaled data, potentially allowing for a distance variable which could more accurately and confidently determine if minority populations are disproportionately exposed to Superfund sites. Additionally, the breakdown of different minority groups can also offer insight into more specific racial trends in relation to Superfund sites. It&rsquo;s been said that those who contribute the least to environmental issues end up suffering from their impacts the most. Putting more focus on this issue allows us to ensure that environmental justice is assured, and that historically marginalized groups are protected from adverse environmental effects.",7,Hidden,blue,North Carolina,35.9427849,-78.5562419,,,geojson/sf_nc_poly.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black;weight:3
